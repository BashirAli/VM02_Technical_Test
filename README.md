# VM02_Technical_Test
This repo is designed to host my results of the technical test assigned by Virgin Media O2, due to an application of their vacant Junior-Mid Data Engineer job role. Developed in PyCharm IDE 2021.2

This repo uses Apache Beam (https://beam.apache.org/) to do the following:
1. Read file from Google Cloud Storage
2. Exclude transactions lower than 20 
3. Exclude transactions earlier than 2010
4. Sum transactions by date
5. Save output to the provided output path 

All relevant code can be found under the ***/src*** folder, the entry file being called main.py respectively.
The repo also includes 1 unit test found under ***/test*** which aims to test all previous transformation steps mentioned (via Composite Transform).
